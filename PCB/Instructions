If you only want 1 or 2 boards, then PM me on Rocketry Forum.  I usually have spares laying around that I can send to you at about $20 USD per copy.

I also have Gerber files from ExpressPCB, but these are for an older design.

Otherwise, follow the directions below to get 3 sets of flight computer and ground station boards from ExpressPCB at about $90USD.  
You will have to cut them on your own with a hacksaw or scroll saw.  Due to the chip shortage, I designed a new board that is compatible with Teensy 3.5/3.6/4.1
and uses Teensy 3.2/4.0 for the ground station.  The  base code is compatible with both versions.  

1)  Download the .pcb file
2)  Download the software from https://www.expresspcb.com/
3)  Open the file in the software
4)  Order the MiniBoard Plus 4-layer Option (3 boards for $90)
